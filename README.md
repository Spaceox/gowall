# gowall
 A desktop wallpaper downloader made in go
 It randomly chooses between:
 - Bing's image of the day (current and old photos) (up to 4k)
 - Chromecast screensaver (resolution isn't really settable and it varies a lot)
 - Windows Spotlight (max 1080p)
 
 In both cases gowall, downloads a random wallpaper from the ones offered and sets it as the desktop wallpaper
